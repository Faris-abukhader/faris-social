- Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is used for styling and UI components, providing a utility-first approach that streamlines development and enables rapid iteration.
- tRPC: tRPC is employed for full type safety in API communication, allowing for seamless integration between the frontend and backend while minimizing runtime errors.
- Drizzle ORM and Prisma ORM: Faris Social utilizes both Drizzle ORM and Prisma ORM for database access, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval with support for relational data modeling.
- Radix UI: The headless UI library Radix is integrated into Faris Social, offering a collection of accessible, customizable components for building a modern user interface.
